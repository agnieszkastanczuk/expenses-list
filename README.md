# Expenses list - a table compliant with Web Accessibility requirements

One of the recruitment tasks was to create a table with a simple form that allows filtering data. While working on this task, I learned how to write code that complies with Web Accessibility requirements [for tables](https://dequeuniversity.com/checklists/web/tables), [lists](https://dequeuniversity.com/checklists/web/lists) and [forms](https://dequeuniversity.com/checklists/web/form-input-labels-instructions).

This is not difficult, and the topic of web acessibility is one that is very important when designing and coding applications. I would like to learn more and use my knowledge of web accesiability in other, more complex projects :)
